# Just One Question

Simple, painless surveys - driven by email.

Just One Question is the answer to long, tedious surveys. You ask one question.
It gets emailed to all of your recipients. They respond to the email with their
answer. The results are caught by an automated system and aggregated for you to
view. It's as simple as that.
